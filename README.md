# Project Idea
### Abstract
In modern healthcare, patients often face a lengthy process involving multiple visits to healthcare providers, especially when assessment of lab tests are required. This traditional approach can be inefficient,
requiring additional time, travel, and expenses. With the rise of digital health technologies, there is an opportunity to streamline this process using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to 
provide quicker, more accessible diagnostic assessments.
### Problem Statement
The inefficiency in the patient journey from initial consultation to diagnosis is marked by the necessity of multiple visits for lab test interpretations. This not only delays potential treatments but also adds 
inconvenience, increased travel, and financial burdens on patients. The challenge lies in reducing the need for follow-up visits while ensuring timely and accurate diagnostic insights to enhance patient care and
reduce healthcare system costs. Hence, the goal is to improve the efficiency of medical diagnostics, making healthcare more accessible and cost-effective for patients.
### Our Approach
To address the inefficiencies identified in the traditional patient journey, our team is developing a digital platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to analyze and 
interpret lab test results. Our approach involves the following key strategies:

1. *Digital Transformation of Lab Result Interpretation:*
   - We are creating a user-friendly website that patients can access to upload their lab test results.
   - The platform uses AI algorithms trained on a wide range of data to analyze the results and provide an immediate interpretation.

2. *Enhancing Patient Understanding and Engagement:*
   - The platform will not only interpret the results but also explain them in a way that is easy for patients to understand, empowering them with knowledge about their health.
   - This feature is designed to help patients make informed decisions about their next steps, whether that involves scheduling a follow-up appointment with their doctor or understanding their health status
    more comprehensively.

3. *Reducing Unnecessary Healthcare Visits:*
   - By providing immediate results and interpretations, our solution aims to reduce the need for follow-up visits that are typically scheduled just to discuss lab results.
   - This can decrease wait times for appointments, travel requirements, and overall healthcare costs for patients.

4. *Scalable and Secure Technology:*
   - Our platform will ensure data privacy and security, complying with healthcare regulations to protect sensitive patient information.
   - Scalability will allow us to expand the range of tests and conditions covered by our AI, continually improving the scope and accuracy of the interpretations.
### Conclusion
Through these strategies, our project aims to streamline the process of lab test interpretation, thereby enhancing the efficiency of healthcare delivery, reducing costs, and improving patient satisfaction 
and outcomes. This approach not only addresses the current inefficiencies but also sets the foundation for future advancements in the integration of AI within healthcare diagnostics.

* Develop the frontend interface for users to upload lab test results and receive immediate diagnosis insights.
   
2. **ML Data Models (Partial Implementation):**
* Train machine learning models on a portion of the dataset to recognize patterns and provide diagnostic predictions.
   
3. **Frontend Profile:**
* Create user profile interfaces on the frontend, allowing users to manage their accounts and view their diagnostic history.


### Last 12 Hours:
1. **Multer Integration (Backend):**
* Integrate Multer or similar middleware on the backend to handle file uploads securely.


2. **Integration of ML Models:**
* Integrate trained machine learning models with the backend to enable automated diagnosis of uploaded lab test result images.


3. **Integration of Frontend and Backend:**
